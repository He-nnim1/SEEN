# 🎉 Fun Calculator 🎮  

A simple yet powerful Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two user-provided numbers.  

## � Features  

- ➕ **Addition** – Adds two numbers.  
- ➖ **Subtraction** – Subtracts the second number from the first.  
- ✖️ **Multiplication** – Multiplies two numbers.  
- ➗ **Division** – Divides the first number by the second (handles decimals).  
- 😎 **User-Friendly** – Easy-to-follow prompts and clear output.  

## 🛠️ How to Use  

1. **Run the script** in a Python environment (Python 3.x required).  
   ```sh
   python fun_calculator.py
   ```
2. **Enter two numbers** when prompted.  
3. **See the results!** The calculator will display:  
   - Sum  
   - Difference  
   - Product  
   - Quotient  

## ⚠️ Note  

- 🔴 **Division by zero** will crash the program (this version doesn’t handle errors—future update?).  
- ✨ **Supports decimals** (thanks to `float()`).  

## 🚀 Future Improvements  

- [ ] Add error handling (e.g., division by zero).  
- [ ] Support more operations (exponents, modulus, etc.).  
- [ ] Add a GUI (Tkinter, PyQt?).  

## 📜 Code Example  

```python
# 🎉 Welcome to the Fun Calculator! 🎉
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))  
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))  

sum_result = num1 + num2  
difference_result = num1 - num2  
product_result = num1 * num2  
quotient_result = num1 / num2  

print(f"Results:")  
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")  
print(f"Difference: {difference_result}")  
print(f"Product: {product_result}")  
print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result}")  
```
